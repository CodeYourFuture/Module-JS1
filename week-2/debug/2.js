// This program should tell the user the last digit of each number.
// Explain why getLastDigit is not working properly - correct the problem

// because the `getLastDigit` function doesn't take any paratmetrs and only does some operation on the
// `num` variable which is constant and has been defined in the first line .` const num=103`
// so doesn't matter what the `getLastdigit` function is given it just return last digit of `num` which is 103.
//actually for this problem there's no need to use a function but if we aims to use function it could be corrected as below.
