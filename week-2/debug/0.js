// Predict and explain first...

function multiply(a, b) {
  console.log(a * b);
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

// this code means a is multipled by b, in this case a is the first number 10 and b is the second number 32, console log will show the answer The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is undefined, it will show undefined becasue there are two console logs and in the function it should be return a*b instead
