// Predict and explain first...

function multiply(a, b) {
  return(a * b);
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

// when running this code: the line 4 will display the result of multiplication, but line 7 will only display the string, because the function is not returning any thing.
// to fix line 7 error we must add new line inside the function body to return(a * b), or change console.log by return.
// I will change line 4 to fix it.
