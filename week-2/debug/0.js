// Predict and explain first...

function multiply(a, b) {
  console.log(a * b);
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

//The first line of the function logs the product of the two arguments to the console. The second line of the code calls the multiply() function with the arguments 10 and 32, and then logs the result to the console. The expected output is:

//320
