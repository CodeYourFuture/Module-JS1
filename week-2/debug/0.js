// Predict and explain first...

function multiply(a, b) {
  console.log(a * b);
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);
10 and 32 are both integers. When we multiply two integers, we get an integer result.
 In this case, the result of multiplying 10 and 32 is 320.

 We define a function called multiply that takes two parameters, a and b.
Inside the function, we use the console.log() method to print the result of multiplying a and b.
We call the multiply function with the arguments 10 and 32.
The multiply function multiplies 10 and 32 and prints the result, which is 320.
