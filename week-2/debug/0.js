// Predict and explain first...

function multiply(a, b) {
  console.log(a * b);
  return a * b;
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

// The code defines a function called "multiply" that takes two parameters, multiplies them, and logs the result to the console.
// But, when the function is called with the values 10 and 32, the calling statement in the console.log attempts to embed the result within a template literal.
// Due to the absence of a return statement in the multiply function, it implicitly returns undefined.
// Consequently, the console outputs the product of 10 and 32 (320) as a result of the function's internal logging, followed by a line stating, "The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is undefined."
// This reflects the attempt to incorporate the undefined return value into the template literal within the console.log statement.
// To fix the code, the return statement is added in line 5 to store the output value obtained from the execution of multiply function.
