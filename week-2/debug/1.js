// Predict and explain first...

function sum(a, b) {
  // return;
  // a + b;
  return a + b;
}

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

// The code defines a function named "sum" intended to add two parameters, a and b.
// However, a critical issue arises with the misplaced return statement, causing the function to prematurely exit and rendering the subsequent addition expression a + b ineffective.
// Consequently, when the function is called within a console.log statement to display the sum of 10 and 32, the output is "The sum of 10 and 32 is undefined."
// To resolve this problem, lines 4 and 5 has been commented out, and an appropriate return statement ,that stores the value of the execution of the sum function, has been added in line 6.
