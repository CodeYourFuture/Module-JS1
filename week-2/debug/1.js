// Predict and explain first...

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

// There is a function sum waiting for 2 values (a, b), there is an issue in the line 4 because the key word return
// is split with semicolon with the action to sum a + b, so you have to erase the semicolon after return.
