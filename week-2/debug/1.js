// Predict and explain first...

function sum(a, b) {
 return;
 a + b }

//console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

// the semi colon in the return statement will stop the function execution. it should be as follows:

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);
