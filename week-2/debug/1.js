// Predict and explain first...

function sum(a, b) {
  return;
  a + b;
}

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);
10 and 32 are both integers. When we multiply two integers, we get an integer result. 
In this case, the result of multiplying 10 and 32 is 320.

We define a function called sum that takes two parameters, a and b.
Inside the function, we use the console.log() method to print the result of adding a and b.
We call the sum function with the arguments 10 and 32.
The sum function adds 10 and 32 and prints the result, which is 320.
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
 }
 
 console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);
