// When selling goods, most are subject to the 20% standard rate of VAT.
// You must add 20% to the price you charge for the goods.
// You can do this by multiplying the price you charge by 1.2.
// For example, if your business sells sports equipment for £50, you multiply £50 by 1.2 for a total VAT inclusive price of £60.

// Implement a function that calculates the new price with VAT (Value Added Tax) added on.

// Given a number,
// When I call this function with a number
<<<<<<< HEAD
// it returns the new price with VAT added on

function priceWithVAT(price) {
  newPrice = price * 1.2;
  return `New price (20% VAT inclusive): £${newPrice}`;
}


console.log(priceWithVAT(60));
console.log(priceWithVAT(39));
console.log(priceWithVAT(28));
=======
// Then it returns the new price with VAT added on
