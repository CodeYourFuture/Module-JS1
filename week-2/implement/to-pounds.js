// Find to-pounds.js in an earlier week in this repo

// Take this code and turn it into a reusable block of code.
// Declare a function called toPounds with an appropriately named parameter.
// Call this function a number of times to check it works for different inputs

function toPounds(food, flour){
    return food + flour;
}
console.log(toPounds(34, 50));

//here is next solution as well.
let x= 20;
let y = 10;
console.log(toPounds(x, y));
