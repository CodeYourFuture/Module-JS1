// Predict and explain first...

// this function should square any number but instead we're going to get an error

function square(num) {
    return num * num;
}
console.log(square(5));
//Prediction: The code is suppose to return num multiply by num because the function is aimed to square any number assigned to the function call and it will also possibly return an error because there is no argument/parameter(num) in the function.
//An error occurred because there is no argument/parameter(num) in the function. The computer doesn't accept figures as a parameter.
