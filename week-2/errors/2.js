// this function should square any number but instead we're going to get an error

function square(num) {
    return num * num;
}
console.log(square(3)); // Output: 9

//The function name should be "square," but you've used the number "3" as the function parameter. Function parameters should be variable names, not specific values.
//You're attempting to square a variable called num, but you haven't defined or declared num anywhere in the function or as a parameter.
