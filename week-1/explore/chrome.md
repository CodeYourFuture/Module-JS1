Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?

ans: I used function greeting(){
alert("Hello World!")
};
greeting();

To invoke mean to call or execute. So when i invoke function 'greeting', a message pops up on screen. It mean alert will appeared the message in screen.

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
ans: It well pop up box of information for user to input some text.
What is the return value of `prompt`?
ans: What is your name? With textbox that user put there name..
