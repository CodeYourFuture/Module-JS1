// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

// const age = 33;

let age = 33;
age = age + 1;


// The issue in this code is that you are attempting to reassign a new value to a 
// constant variable (age) after it has been initially assigned a value, and then reassign the value by 1 
// In JavaScript, const is used to declare a variable whose value should not be reassigned after it's 
// initially set. Therefore, attempting to modify or reassign a const variable will result in an error.

// solutions
/*
To resolve this issue, you should use let instead of const 
if you want to declare a variable that can be reassigned.
