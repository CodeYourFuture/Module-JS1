// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

let age = 33; //variable created with "const" is constant and unchangeable. We fix this by reassigning the variable with "let"
age++; // We can increase the variable by using age = age + 1 or simply using age++ as done here
console.log(age);
