// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

// const age = 33;
// age = age + 1;

// In js if we use const to declare a variable its value cannot be reassigned. If we want to modify the value, we should use let instead of const.

let age = 33;
age = age + 1;
// This will work because it will alow us to reassign the values.
