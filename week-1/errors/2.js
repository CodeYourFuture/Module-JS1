// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

// Cannot access 'cityOfBirth' before initialization.
// The variable should be declared first

// console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
// const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}.`);
