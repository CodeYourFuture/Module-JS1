// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?


const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

// By declaring cityOfBirth before using it in the template string, we can be able to print the string "I was born in Bolton" without any issues.
