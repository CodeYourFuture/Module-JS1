const minimum = 1;

const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maximum - minimum + 1)) + minimum;

// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents? it will give us a random number between max end min, including max and min
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num several times to build an idea of what the program is doing

// it is giving us a random integer number between min and max including min and math

console.log(num);
