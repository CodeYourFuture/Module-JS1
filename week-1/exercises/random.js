// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num several times to build an idea of what the program is doing

//ans : we declared variable minimum with vale 1, and maximum with 100. We have an other variable num with statement. 
 //We use Meth.floor method to erase decimal point and Math.random method to take any number include 0 and exclusive 101.
 //Math.random will take any number between
