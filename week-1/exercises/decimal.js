const num = 58.4567;

const wholeNumberPart = Math.round(num) - 2;
const decimalPart = num - 58;

// You should look up Math functions for this exercise https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math

// Create a variable called wholeNumberPart and assign to it an expression that evaluates to 56 ( the whole number part of num )
// Create a variable called decimalPart and assign to it an expression that evaluates to 0.4567 ( the decimal part of num )
// Create a variable called roundedNum and assign to it an expression that evaluates to 57 ( num rounded to the nearest whole number )

// Log your variables to the console to check your answers
