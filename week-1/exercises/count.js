let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing.

//answer
//  "=" is an assignment operator in coding for example in line 1 and variable declaration 0 has been assigned to "count" variable.
//and in line 3 it says add up count with 1 and assign it again to "count" . initial value was 0 , added up with 1 which is 1 and assigned
// again to ocunt so the new value of "count" is 1 . 
//count=1 , next itrate would be count=count(==1)+1 => count=2
