let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
//= is giving value to the variable count as 0
//line 3 which is {count = count +1} is assigning new value to the variable count which is 0 + 1 so the result is 1
