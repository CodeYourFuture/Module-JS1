let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// => = is assignment operator. so the new value of count is 0 + 1, 1. so this line 3 shows the increment the value of count by 1.
