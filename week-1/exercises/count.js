let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

console.log(count);

// = operator in line 3 is used to update the value of the count variable. 
// It assigns a new value to the variable, which is the result of adding 1 to its previous value. 
// After this line of code is executed, the count variable will have a new value of 1.
