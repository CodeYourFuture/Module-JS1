let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 - Its changing the count from its original state. The reason being is because Count originally equals 0 on line 1
// But then on line 3 were saying count should now equal count + 1, and 0 + 1 = 1. So count is now 1.
