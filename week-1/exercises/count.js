let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
 line 3 is updating the value of the count variable to be 1. After this line of code executes, the count variable will no longer be 0; it will have been incremented to 1.
