let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//line 3 is adding 1 in its initial value which was 0. And then reassigning that value to the count by adding 1. So now count has a value of 1.
