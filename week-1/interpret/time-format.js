// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?
// a answer) there are 7 variable declaration in this program.

// b) How many function calls are there?
// b answer) 0

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?
// e answer)

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer
