// There is an implementation of format-as-12-hours.js in the debug directory
// This implementation currently uses the expression Number(time.slice(0, 2)) twice
// Store this expression in a variable and reference it twice in the function in the correct place

// Explain why it makes more sense to store this expression in a variable


 // Explanation:
 // Storing the expression in a variable enhances the readability of the code and makes it easier to understand the purpose of that particular value. Additionally, by storing it in a variable, you avoid recalculating the same value multiple times.
