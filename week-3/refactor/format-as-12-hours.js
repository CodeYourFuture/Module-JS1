// There is an implementation of format-as-12-hours.js in the debug directory
// This implementation currently uses the expression Number(time.slice(0, 2)) twice
// Store this expression in a variable and reference it twice in the function in the correct place

// Explain why it makes more sense to store this expression in a variable

//when we stor this expression in a variable help us for good code Readability and Maintainability -
// we can Reuse our code, if we use the same expression multiple times in our code.
// it also help our code to be clear, if we store them in a variable with a meaningful name can help clarify the purpose of the expression and the sequence of operations bing performed.
