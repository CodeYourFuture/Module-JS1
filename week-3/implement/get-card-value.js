// This problem involves playing cards: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck

// You will need to implement a function getCardValue

// You need to write assertions for your function to check it works in different cases

// Acceptance criteria:

// Given a card string in the format "A♠" (representing a card in blackjack),
// When the function getCardValue is called with this card string as input,
// Then it should return the numerical card value

// Handle Number Cards (2-10):
// Given a card with a rank between "2" and "10",
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should return the numeric value corresponding to the rank (e.g., "5" should return 5).

// Handle Face Cards (J, Q, K):
// Given a card with a rank of "J," "Q," or "K",
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should return the value 10, as these cards are worth 10 points each in blackjack.

// Handle Ace (A):
// Given a card with a rank of "A",
// When the function is called with an Ace,
// Then it should, by default, assume the Ace is worth 11 points, which is a common rule in blackjack.

// Handle Invalid Cards:
// Given a card with an invalid rank (neither a number nor a recognized face card),
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should throw an error indicating "Invalid card rank."

function getCardValue(cardString) {
  const [rank, suit] = cardString.split("♠");
  switch (rank) {
    case "2":
    case "3":
    case "4":
    case "5":
    case "6":
    case "7":
    case "8":
    case "9":
    case "10":
      return parseInt(rank);
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
      return 10;
    case "A":
      return 11;
    default:
      throw new Error("Invalid card rank.");
  }
}
console.log(getCardValue(10));
